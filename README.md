# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jacob Frericks, and I'm a DevSecOps engineer. I have a passion for automating annoying/tedious tasks. You can see a full list of what I am up to below. If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to send a [tip](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jacobfrericks), give me a shout out [@JacobFrericks_](https://twitter.com/jacobfrericks_), or give some â™¥ on [dev.to/jacobfrericks](https://dev.to/jacobfrericks)!

### My Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

I write regular blog posts, most of which you will find on [dev.to/jacobfrericks](https://dev.to/jacobfrericks).

I write about things I am familiar with, things I can automate, and things that I am learning. Day to day I work on applications that help others! 

If you have ideas on what could be automated, please create an issue in the repo [JacobFrericks](https://www.github.com/jacobfrericks/jacobfrericks) and assign it to project "ideas". I'm always interested in more automation ideas!
