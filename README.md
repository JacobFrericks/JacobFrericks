Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I create blog posts and open source applications! 
I have a passion for development and best security practices. 
You can see a full list of what I am up to on [jacobfrericks.com](jacobfrericks.com). 
If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to send a [tip](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jacobfrericks), give me a shout out [@JacTheDev](https://twitter.com/JacTheDev), 
or give some â™¥ on [DEV.to/jacobfrericks](https://dev.to/jacobfrericks)!

### My Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

I write regular blog posts, most of which you will find on [dev.to/jacobfrericks](https://dev.to/jacobfrericks).

I write about things I am familiar with, things that trip up folks that I work with, and things that I am learning.  Day to day I make applications that help others!
