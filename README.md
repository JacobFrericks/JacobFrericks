# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jacob Frericks, and I'm a DevSecOps engineer. I have a passion for automating annoying/tedious tasks. You can see a full list of what I am up to below. If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to send a [tip](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jacobfrericks), give me a shout out [@JacobFrericks_](https://twitter.com/jacobfrericks_), or give some â™¥ on [dev.to/jacobfrericks](https://dev.to/jacobfrericks)!

### My Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

I write regular blog posts, most of which you will find on [dev.to/jacobfrericks](https://dev.to/jacobfrericks).

I write about things I am familiar with, things I can automate, and things that I am learning. Day to day I work on applications that help others! 

If you have ideas on what could be automated, please create an issue in the repo JacobFrericks and assign it to project "ideas". I'm always interested in more automation ideas!
